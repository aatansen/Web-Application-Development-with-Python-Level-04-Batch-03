### Preskool Project 02 Add student
- To add student we created a form `studentadd.html` where required fields are taken
- Create a custom model `CustomUserModel` to save the user login information with user type
- According to the fields in `studentadd.html` create a model `StudentAddModel`
- This model will have all the required info including a relational field with custom model which is `user=models.OneToOneField(CustomUserModel,on_delete=models.CASCADE)`
- Now after getting data from the form in `studentadd` function first we have to save the `username`,`password` and `user_type` in `CustomUserModel`
- Save other info in `StudentAddModel` along with `user`
    ```python
    def studentadd(request):
        department =DepartmentAddModel.objects.all()
        sessions =SessionAddModel.objects.all()
